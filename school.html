			<p>Education is one of the most important aspects in my life. I worked my hardest during school to succede in life. I completed my +2 course from Mahesh Sri Ramkrisna Asrama Vidyalaya.</p>
 			<p>My goal is to be a good engineer. I feel as though my education is what keeps me on the right track. I had ambition to get to good college one day and this ambition helped me stay focused and do well in school. I know that the more education you have the better your career will be so I felt that working very hard right now will most definitely pay off in the long run. With education I will be the hardworking I was destined to be.</p>
			<p>I got admitted to one of the finest college in India: Jadavpur University in the department of Computer science. I have always try to maintain a good cgpa in my semester exams. I like to code and design. I have also good knowledge in crptography.</p>
 			<p>I hope jadavpur university will be good platform to fulfill my dream. My education is one of the most important things I need to succeed.</p>
